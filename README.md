_Recreated a web app using different JavaScript frameworks_

I recreated the Cow Clicker Game, to demonstrate proficiencies in JavaScript frameworks and MVC document structure.


##How To Play
1. Open **index.html** in your browser, from the selected framework folder.
2. Select your cat and begin clicking!
3. Each cat will hold its value, allowing you to switch between kitties without losing your score.
